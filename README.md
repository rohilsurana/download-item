# download-item

An element providing a ui and controls like pause, resume and retry for
a item downloading in the backend.
You can use the HTML5 persistence storage and other available FileSystem APIs
to create a downloader backend for this to work with browsers.
For installation -

    bower install rohilsurana/download-item

For documentation and example have a look at
[download-item](http://rohilsurana.github.io/download-item/)


## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install


## Playing With the Element

If you wish to work on the element in isolation, I recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep the element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview the element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/download-item/`, where `download-item` is the name of the directory containing it.
